Build Instructions

    These are instructions how to build wxD using the standard GNU toolsets.
    It is also possible to build from the DOS prompt or using an graphic IDE.
    You are assumed to already have your compilers and wx libraries installed.
    See the README file for details, and the LICENCE file for legal conditions.

    cd wxd
    make
	Run this from a shell (i.e. MSYS for Windows, Terminal for Mac OS X)
	See below for available variables and targets, to the "make" command.

Supported platforms

    GNU/Linux
    FreeBSD
	version(__WXGTK__)

    Windows
	version(__WXMSW__)

    Macintosh
	version(__WXMAC__)

Required software

    Make program

    C++ compiler

    D compiler

    wxWidgets

Make variables

    COMPILER = [ GDC | DMD | LDC ]

    LIBRARY = [ Phobos | Tango ]

    MAKE = make

    CXX = g++
    CXXFLAGS = -O2 -Wall

    DC = gdc
    DFLAGS = -O2 -g

    WX_CONFIG = wx-config
    LDFLAGS = 

    INSTALL = install
    PREFIX = /usr/local

Make targets

    all
	This will build the required wxc (in C++) and wxd (in D) libraries.

    build
	This will generate the wx.libs module, for use with version(build).

    install
	This will install all import modules and static libraries, for wxD.

    samp
	This will build the Samples, results end up in the "bin" directory.

    docs
	This will build the embedded documentation to the "html" directory.

    clean
	This will remove the objects and libraries, and the generated files.
